# arithmetic operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulo
# particulary for numbers but some may be fitted on strings and other objects


# logical operators: focus on main three (and, or, not)
# and 
    # always appears between two values and returns true if BOTH values are true


# or
    # returns true if at least one value is true


# not
    # operates on only one operand, returns the neagted opposite value



# Operator Precedence
# each three comes in two versions
    # and , &&
    # or , ||
    # not, !

    # the symbols are prioritized over the word operators
