## Focus of Repo

Algorithm - Each Algo is a file of its own. Find a concept, explain the concept and practice === one file.
1. In the future (>= 30 .rb files) then I may think about containerizing some files.

WebApps4Beginners - Complete Book from Start  to Finish. If Familiar or old content then I should go faster. Every excuse to fail so pointless. Make a win to succeed.
1. Plan A track, Refresh and Complete.
  
Ruby4Beginners - COMPLETED. This is a good manual for my own reference. No need to edit.
