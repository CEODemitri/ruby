# note to self

if revising, best to find and use the corresponding file instead of making a new one. this entire file is huge enough

## to do

find a suitable ruby doc or book and follow while wrapping up the educative course.
FOUND: wikibooks

after a monh hiatus, ready to takle and learn more. As i stated in the escapeSequence file (First rb program back), much more progress is neccesary
